# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue

The sports clothing industry is thriving!, driven by increasing demand for activewear and fitness-related products. In this project, I delved into the data of an online sports retail company to extract insights that can help maximize revenue. Using SQL, I have explored numeric, string, and timestamp data related to pricing, revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

#Project Tasks
1. Counting Missing Values
To ensure data integrity, I began by identifying and counting missing values across various attributes. This step allows me to understand the completeness of the dataset and decide on appropriate strategies for handling missing information.

2. Nike vs. Adidas Pricing
I conducted a comparative analysis of pricing between two major sportswear brands, Nike and Adidas. This involved examining the distribution of prices for products from each brand, providing valuable insights for pricing strategies and market positioning.

3. Labeling Price Ranges
To simplify the interpretation of pricing data, I categorized products into price ranges. This labeling facilitates the identification of trends, consumer preferences, and opportunities for targeted marketing.

4. Average Discount by Brand
Analyzing average discounts by brand revealed insights into customer behavior and brand loyalty. Understanding how customers respond to discounts from different brands helps in optimizing promotional strategies.

5. Correlation Between Revenue and Reviews
I explored the relationship between revenue and customer reviews, using correlation analysis. This insight aids in understanding the impact of customer feedback on sales and provides direction for customer satisfaction improvement.

6. Ratings and Reviews by Product Description Length
Analyzing ratings and reviews in relation to the length of product descriptions highlighted the influence of information depth on customer satisfaction. This information is crucial for optimizing product descriptions for better customer engagement.

7. Reviews by Month and Brand
I investigated the distribution of reviews over months for different brands. This temporal analysis offers insights into seasonal patterns, helping the company align marketing efforts with consumer behavior.

8. Footwear Product Performance
Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), I segmented and analyzed the performance of footwear products. This in-depth exploration allowed for tailored recommendations on marketing, inventory management, and product development.

9. Clothing Product Performance
Extending my analysis to clothing products, I applied similar methodologies to derive insights specific to this category. The findings contribute to a holistic understanding of the company's product portfolio.
